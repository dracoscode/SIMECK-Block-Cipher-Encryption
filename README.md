# SIMECK-Block-Cipher-Encryption
SIMECK Block Cipher is a lightweight block cipher which combined SIMON and SPECK.

This repository contains the code and findings of an undergraduate research project that implemented and analyzed the SIMECK lightweight block cipher algorithm in the C programming language. The project was part of a course on cryptography and aimed to deepen the understanding of lightweight cryptographic systems.

# Project Overview

The SIMECK cipher, a variant of the renowned SIMON and SPECK ciphers, was thoroughly studied. The C implementation of the cipher includes the key scheduling, encryption, and decryption processes. The project also conducted extensive tests against known SIMECK test vectors and carried out a performance analysis of the cipher.

# Features

Key Scheduling: Efficient computation of round keys for the SIMECK block cipher.
Encryption: Conversion of plaintext into ciphertext using the generated keys.
Decryption: Conversion of ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the generated keys.
